Rogalia MMO game client available in the browser and on Steam.

- [Steam](store.steampowered.com/app/528460/)
- [Browser](http://rogalia.ru/play)

## Windows build instructions

The Rogalia client requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed. Currently the LTS suffices.

In the client directory run the following command
> npm install

# Webserver

To develop and test the application rapidly run the Rogalia client on a webserver e.g. Apache or NGINX.
Navigate to
> localhost/index.html

# NW.js executable

To run the client in a Webkit executable [NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) x32 is required.

> Extract the NW.js binary package

> Drag the Rogalia directory, not the package.json itself, on to the NW.js executable (nwjs.exe) in your NW.JS directory.

NOTE: Make sure your Steam client is running in the background.
